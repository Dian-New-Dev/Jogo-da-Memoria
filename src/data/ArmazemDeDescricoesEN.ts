    //campones 
    "“There is no more water,” cried the peasants, mercilessly beaten by government officials as they returned to the kingdom's gates with their empty jars and baskets. The first ones were executed, accused of stealing water and fruits from the Pharaoh. Soon, however, the news that the Nile had dried up and the crops along its banks had died swept through the kingdom. Today, the peasants return to the banks of the dead river. No longer to harvest or plant, but to await the will of the gods: either the Nile is reborn before their eyes, or the peasants die waiting.", 
    
    //vizir 
    "The Pharaoh's advisor. Every decision our Sun-God makes echoes his whispers. He was the one who brought the royal entourage to my humble home, gently urging me to abandon everything and seek water for our people. Always pompous, he bravely fought not to faint from hunger during the blessing ceremony for my journey.", 
    
    //sacerdotisa 
    "Goddess Isis should take care of our land's fertility so that our crops grow abundantly. What we did to deserve her neglect, no one knows, but the priestesses of Isis were the first to pay the price for our doubts. Those who remained in the temples were taken to the catacombs, accused of offending the goddess of fertility. Those who fled descended from their religious pedestal to become a meal for furious, desperate, and starving hordes. The death of the priestesses resolved nothing.", 
    
    //general 
    "“We do not need another general,” they said after yet another one starved to death. “Our enemy is not defeated with spears and arrows,” they continued in desperate persistence. But the Sun-God knows more than they do. The Pharaoh insisted on another ceremony, another appointment, another mid-level military officer abruptly elevated to the top of the military hierarchy. The new General could not even raise the Ceremonial Spear to the heavens as protocol dictates. In other times, he would have been executed for disrespecting the Pharaoh and Montu. Nowadays, it would be a merciful death.", 
    
    //artesão 
    "They have always been seen as being blessed with the gift of refined work, capable of shaping rough material into beauty and desire, although nothing ever truly belonged to them. Their sacred vessels always fled to temples. Their shining jewels always taken by nobles. Not even their beautiful statues escaped being siphoned off to palaces and mastabas. For when water ran out, food ceased, and madness swept through the Kingdom like a sandstorm, most artisans locked themselves in their workshops, closing themselves off in hungry communion with their creations.", 
    
    //escriba 
    "One of several royal scribes, in his daily task of recording how many souls have been reaped by thirst and sent prematurely into Anubis' arms. Sworn to fulfill their duties regardless of difficulties, they are forced to continue working until their living flesh wastes off their fingers. Many die over scrolls while others go mad recording their own names as if hoping to perish soon.", 
    
    //filha 
    "My daughter, at the moment I said goodbye to her. She always wanted to be a princess, and on the day she is adorned, decorated, and perfumed as such, disguising her weakness and malnutrition in homage to my bravery, all she can do is cry asking me not to go. I will return to you, my dear. I shall see you smile again as the princess you are.", 
    
    //guarda 
    "They have always prioritized the safety of nobles, priests, and members of the royal court. When the hungry began to gather in fierce and unpredictable masses, guards began washing their swords and spears with common blood. It soon became evident that those massive waves of starving people with nothing left to lose were unbeatable opponents against a few guards committed to their orders. The surviving guards were transferred for the security of the royal palace and court under promise of water and food. When I went out into the desert, that promise was still unfulfilled.", 
    
    //sacerdote 
    "If government officials are concerned with maintaining order and laws, priests are concerned with morality and respect for the gods. The former suggested exterminating the vermin; the latter recommended purification. The former recommended locking up the court and Pharaoh inside the palace; the latter insisted on the need for our God-King to join the people. The former implored that Ra's son sent troops into the desert in search of water; the latter reminded him of the prophecy of the 20. Only in one of these clashes did the priests prevail.", 
    
    //criança 
    "They are not guilty of anything that happens; they have not lived long enough to have had a chance to offend the gods. In Amon-Ra's eyes, that makes no difference: they will suffer for their parents' sins and suffer doubly because unlike them, little ones have less flesh for their bodies to devour when hunger reaches unsustainable levels. But it is in their eyes, innocent like nothing else in this world, that hope persists. When faith dies there, we will all be lost.", 
    
    //escravos 
    "Once symbols of our victories and military prowess, now evidence of our resounding defeat before divine wrath. Slaves no longer exist. They were among the first to disappear because devouring one’s own kind is an act of horror while devouring captured animals is merely an act of survival. Or so said Set's priests.", 
    
    //nobreza 
    "The nobility would last longer than the people. They had stocks of water and food, and their small numbers allowed them to coordinate rationing efforts impossible for the masses. But they forgot that in the face of hunger, thirst, and fear of death, the masses forget laws and revert to a barbaric state like that of early men from the desert. Forgotten by gods and Pharaoh, who brought all city guards into his palace, the nobles could only watch in horror as starving people climbed walls and balconies of their residences.", 
    
    //guardiao 
    "They guard temples dedicated to gods as well as immense riches deposited within them. They would kill thieves and deny a single coin to starving homeless people passing by. And today, as gold goes back to being nothing but a piece of metal, the guardians suffer just as much as the beggars.", 
    
    //rainha 
    "Once regarded as the most beautiful woman in all Egypt, today our Queen appears as moribund as even her poorest subjects. She cries over her people's death; she cries over her children's death; she cries over her husband's decay. She cries so much that there are no more tears left in her body. From her burning eyes flows hot blood when she cries once more.", 
    
    //faraó 
    "The Sun-God, son of Ra, guardian of men and sun, and the reason we are still here. If gods chose to punish our sins with a slow death instead of destroying the Kingdom in a sudden sandstorm, it is because our Pharaoh intercedes for his people. He is hungry like us; he faces thirst like us; fights exhaustion like us but cannot collapse like us. He must remain firm even if his body devours itself while his Kingdom shakes in chaos and terror. He keeps us standing, to the very end.", 
    
    //engenheiro 
    "Most died shortly after the slaves, more from melancholy than anything else. As soon as sphinxes, temples, and unfinished palaces ceased being erected, royal engineers lost their purpose and were no longer considered by the gods. Those who did not succumb to sadness at seeing their kingdom's structure crumble sought refuge in palaces many helped build. None were allowed inside.", 
    
    //embalsamador 
    "No nobleman, priest or court member would dare diying like a commoner. They'd pay embalmers and gravediggers enough coins for peace when ascending into Anubis' fields, certain that their bodies would be mummified and laid at eternal rest in mastabas. Only embalmers could honor this service; the rich who died were indeed wrapped up but would end up left abandoned at random when graves ran out, gravediggers died and their children replaced respect for the dead for survival instinct.", 
    
    //ritualista 
    'Take your finest jewels, most delicious fruits and silkiest fabrics and cast them into Nile&#39s dry bed at Set&#39s feet." "Raise great bonfires at Thoth&#39s temple; cast your flocks into flames as a sign of your unwavering faith in the divine designs."Fast and show Ra your obstinacy by nourishing only on faith." "Take your slaves, the weight of your perdition, and sacrifice them by drinking their impure blood to cleanse your land from sin." "Sacrifice your children! Let their pure souls ascend to heaven and move Anubis who will weep rain upon us." "Devour your offerings!"', 
    
    //loucos 
    "They used to emerge from the desert heat when it'd fry their brains. Lately they began appearing en masse in  the city.I envy them: madness has perverted them enough that they confuse pain with pleasure and fear with joy. They end up as corpses sunk into ground who died with mouths full of sand and lived their last moments in incomprehensible joy, which will be denied  to us, sane ones.", 
    
    //astronomo 
    'The first nine or ten had detailed maps produced by the best astronomers, yet they found nothing. The five or six after them received hastily drawn sketches where whispers from the stars indicated possible water sources. The ones before me received no direction or instruction. When I was at the gate ready to depart, the last living astronomer came stumbling toward me leaving nothing more than a note: "To the eye in the sky, nothing ever escapes"',
    
    //devoto
    "The real ones died kneeling. The false ones became worms with legs."
